# encryption_exercise
Simple encryption/decryption tool.
I'll start by saying, I've never created a README file before, and I'm not sure what to include here.

I created this program in response to challenge posed by a friend. The goal is to create an encryption/decryption program that replaces each letter in the message with the next letter in the alphabet. 

I used the Caesar cipher encryption method, in combination with ASCII code, to achieve this.

This program was coded in Python3.
